Hi, I'm Athena Liu! I'm a PhD student and a web developer based in Vancouver, Canada.

I am currently working towards my doctorial degree 🎓 in Fluid Mechanics in the University of British Columbia.

I have a passion for the latest web technology 💻 , and am always striving to learn and improve my skills by doing fun projects as a hobbyist and as a freelancing developer. My current focus is on ReactJS, which I used to build this site!

In my free time, I enjoy cuddling with my cats 🐱🐱, Vikki and Vance, making origami and stamp carving. I am also training to get my blue cord in historical rapier fencing ⚔ this year.

Feel free to email me if you would like to collaborate on a project, or learn more about me.
